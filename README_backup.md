## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm
- Modern web browser with Web Workers support

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/MMALI3287/wordle-helper.git
cd wordle-helper

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

The app will be available at `http://localhost:3001` (or next available port).

### Production Build

```bash
# Create optimized production build
npm run build

# Preview production build locally
npm run preview
```

## 🎮 How to Use

### 1. **Choose Word Length**

- Select from 3-12 letters using the dropdown (default: 5 letters)
- App loads appropriate word database (15K-30K words depending on length)

### 2. **Get Starting Word Suggestions**

- When no constraints are set, see pre-computed optimal starting words
- Each word shows entropy score and research-backed description
- Starting words optimized for each word length

### 3. **Add Constraints by Dragging Letters**

#### 🟩 **Green Letters (Correct Positions)**

- Drag letters to numbered position slots
- Letters turn green with "×" button to remove
- Right-click to convert to yellow letter

#### 🟨 **Yellow Letters (Wrong Positions)**

- Drag letters to position slots under "Yellow" section
- Specify which positions the letter is NOT in
- Letters show exclusion positions (e.g., "≠2" means not in position 2)
- Can exclude multiple positions for same letter

#### ⬛ **Gray Letters (Not in Word)**

- Drag letters to gray area to mark as not in word
- Eliminates all words containing these letters

### 4. **Get Optimal Suggestions**

- Once constraints are added, app calculates entropy for all words
- Results show words ranked by information gain
- Higher bits = better choice for narrowing possibilities
- Calculations happen in background Web Worker (non-blocking)

### 5. **Monitor Progress**

- See filtered word count update in real-time
- Progress indicators during entropy calculations
- Victory celebration when down to 1 word!

### Production Build- **TypeScript**: Full type safety and excellent developer experienceYour app is ready to be deployed!

````bash- **Modern React**: React 19+ with hooks and functional components

# Create optimized production build

npm run build- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first styling for rapid developmentSee the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.



# Preview production build locally- **ESLint & Prettier**: Code quality and consistency tools

npm run preview

```### `npm run eject`



## 🎮 How to Use## 🚀 Quick Start



1. **Set Word Length**: Choose your target word length (default: 5 letters)**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**



2. **Enter Known Information**:### Prerequisites

   - **Green Letters**: Drag letters to correct positions

   - **Yellow Letters**: Add letters that exist but are in wrong positions- Node.js 18+ and npmIf you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

   - **Gray Letters**: Add letters that don't exist in the word

- Modern web browser with Web Workers support

3. **Get Suggestions**:

   - **Starting Words**: See optimal first guesses when you have no constraintsInstead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

   - **Optimal Next Words**: Get entropy-ranked suggestions based on your constraints

### Installation

4. **Refine Results**: The app automatically filters possible words and suggests the most informative next guesses

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
